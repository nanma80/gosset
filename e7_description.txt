Here's the 7D semi-regular polytope 3_{21} with the E7 symmetry projected from 7D down to 3D. With a simple rotation in the 7D space, the 3D shadow changes between a dodecahedron and an icosahedron. It has 56 vertices, 756 edges, and 4032 2D faces. With the faces we can see the convex hull better. Without the faces we can peek the edges better. Numerically, I see that the icosahedral shadow is the largest shadow of this polytope over all 7D -> 3D projections. I don't have an analytical proof.

For another solid: 6-demicube, in 6D, the 3D shadow appears similar. I have to choose a different and less graceful way to perform the rotation in 6D so that the shadow changes between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. Again, the icosahedron shadow of the 6-demicube is the largest shadow achievable.

This blog page https://vzome.com/home/geometry/gossets-polytopes/ shows the projection of 3_{21} with the dodecahedral shadow in vZome. The icosahedral shadow must be constructible using vZome as well.
